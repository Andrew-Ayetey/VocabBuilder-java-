1. Initial Setup
Project Creation: Start by creating a new Java project in your preferred IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
Library Integration: Use Maven or Gradle to include libraries such as Apache Commons CSV (for CSV handling), Gson or Jackson (for JSON parsing), and JavaFX or Swing (for GUI, if needed).

2. Designing the Core Logic
CSV Reading Function: Develop a function to read words from the input CSV file.
API Integration: Write a function to make HTTP requests to dictionaryapi.dev for each word and handle the JSON response.
CSV Writing Function: Create a function to format the fetched definitions and write them to a new CSV file compatible with Anki's import format.
3. Building the User Interface (Optional)
Layout Design: If you choose to add a GUI, design a simple and user-friendly interface with JavaFX or Swing.
File Selection: Implement a file chooser for users to select the input CSV file.
Processing Button: Add a button to initiate the processing of the CSV file.
Status Indicators: Include status messages or progress indicators to inform the user about the process (like "Processing", "Completed", "Error").
4. Integration and Testing
Integrating Components: Combine the CSV handling, API calls, JSON parsing, and GUI into a cohesive application.
Testing: Conduct thorough testing with different CSV files to ensure the application handles various scenarios, including large files, network errors, and parsing issues.
5. Error Handling and User Feedback
Robust Error Handling: Implement comprehensive error handling to catch and manage potential issues during file reading, API requests, and writing output.
User Communication: Ensure the application provides clear feedback to the user, especially in case of errors or successful completion.
6. Documentation and Packaging
Writing Documentation: Create documentation explaining how to use the application, including any prerequisites or limitations.
Packaging for Distribution: Use tools like Launch4j or JPackage to package the application into an executable for different operating systems.
7. Refinement and Future Improvements
User Feedback: Gather user feedback for further refinement.
Additional Features: Consider adding features like batch processing, custom definition formatting, or integration with other APIs.
8. Maintenance and Updates
Regular Maintenance: Regularly update the application to maintain compatibility with new operating system versions and external APIs.
Addressing Issues: Actively address any bugs or issues reported by users.
This workflow covers the entire process from initial setup to deployment and maintenance. Each step involves a mix of coding, testing, and user interface design, focusing on creating a reliable and user-friendly tool.
